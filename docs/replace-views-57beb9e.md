# Replace Views

You can replace a specific view in an original application with a new view.



## Context

-   The new view can be edited using the layout editor.
-   The new view replaces the view provided by SAP. Any future changes made to the SAP view will not be reflected in the new view. Furthermore, if the new view is an empty view, any functionality that was previously provided by the SAP view will not be available.



## Procedure

1.  Right-click on any folder of the extension project to which you want to add the extension and click *Create Extension*.

2.  Make sure that the desired extension project is selected and click *Next*.

3.  Select *Replace View* and click *Next*.

4.  Select the view that you want to replace.

5.  From the *Replace with* dropdown list, select *Copy of the original view* to edit the view based on the original view, or select *Empty View* to replace the view with an entirely new one.

6.  Click *Next*.

7.  Click *Finish* to add the extension to the selected extension project.
