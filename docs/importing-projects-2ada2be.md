# Importing Projects

Import projects from your local file system to SAP Business Application Studio.

If you have an SAP Web IDE project or a project you worked on in another IDE, you can save it as a ZIP or a TAR file and import it to SAP Business Application Studio.

1.  Make sure there is an open workspace in your dev space. If there is no open workspace:
    1.  Click *Open Folder*.
    2.  Select *projects* from the list provided in the command palette.
    3.  Click *OK*.

2.  From the *Get Started* page, click *Import*, or select *SAP Business Application Studio: Import Project* from the command palette.
3.  Select the desired ZIP or TAR file.
4.  Click *Open*.

The project is added to your dev space in a new workspace or as part or a multi-root workspace depending on the Workspace preferences that you defined.
